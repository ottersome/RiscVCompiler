For the 4th project, you need to generate and run RISC-V code.

In my classnotes, we generate Java bytecode for easy understanding.  You do not need to worry about register management when generating Java bytecode.  JVM and Java bytecode is explained in the document "211-2CODE.GENERATION.pdf".

In our project, you need to generate and run RISC-V assembly code. Please read the file "Java bytecode2RISCVasm20191031.pdf" for converting Java bytecode to RISC-V assembly.

Please read the file "211-2RISCV.pdf" for a introduction to RISC-V assembly. More detailed documents are in the directory "RISC-V-assembly-references".

In order to run RISC-V code on your computer, please install a DOCKER container.  Please see the file 
"DOCKER-stage-3/LabNotes-Install RISC-V environment with a Docker image=v20191010=keep.pdf".
 


For the 4th (symbol table) project, you need to turn in your lex files, yacc files, semantic routine files, test cases, and the executable code. You also need to write a readme.txt file for the project, telling the TA how to run your program. You also need to turn in a file output.txt showing the output of your program. For the output, you can also show the screen dump (as a jpg file) when running your program.

Put all of the above files in a single zip file which will be named "DDDDDDD-symtab.zip", where
DDDDDDD is your student id. Upload the zip to the new e3 platform.

Deadline of the 4th project is January 8, 2020, Wednesday, 23:55 pm.
